# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the programming challenges in Advent of Code 2025. See
[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/). I will post my solutions here but not the problem descriptions
themselves because of copyright / intellectual property concerns. However, with each solution I will post a link to the
problem description on the Advent of Code site, so it's easy to look up.

I use Go as my programming language for the challenges.
